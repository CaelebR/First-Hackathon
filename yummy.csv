Preheat the grill to medium-high. 3. Thread the cubed fish onto skewers. Drizzle with oil, and turn gently to coat. 4. Cook the fish skewers until cooked through and lightly charred (6-8 minutes). Just before removing from the grill, brush over with the glaze. 5. Serve with rice, and garnish with the scallion and sesame seeds. ;Asian;13;0;recipe-book-main\Recipes\Asian\Tears of Selûne.md
Chocolate Chip Cookies;Granulated Sugar,Brown Sugar,Salt,Butter,Vanilla Extract,Flour,Baking Soda,Milk,Chocolate;;1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. 2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. 3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula. > [!warning] Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies. 4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for **at least** 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be.  ;Baking;1;0;recipe-book-main\Recipes\Baking\Chocolate Chip Cookies.md
Goldenstars;Flour,Granulated Sugar,Onion Powder,Baking Soda,Salt,Black Pepper,Oil,Sausage,Potato,Butter,Leek,Thyme,Flour,Chicken Broth,Black Pepper,Parsley,Egg wash;Freshly ground,;1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, onion powder, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk together. 2. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, neutral oil, and water. Whisk until one homogenous mixture. 3. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and fold until incorporated into a dough. 4. Halve the dough onto a work surface and pat it into two six-inch disks.  5. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for ±1 hour.  1. Line a small plate with a paper towel and set aside. 2. In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small crumbles. 3. When it no longer appears raw, transfer the sausage to the prepared plate, leaving as much fat in the skillet as possible. 4. Add the potato, water, and a pinch of salt to the skillet on medium heat and cook, covered. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook until the potato starts to soften, ±10 minutes. 5. Add the butter and let melt, coating the pan. Then, add the leek, thyme, a pinch of salt, and cook until soft, ±2 minutes. 6. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the skillet. Cook until thickened, about 1 1/2 minutes. > [!Hint] The texture will be quite thick, like mashed potatoes. 7. Add the reserved sausage and stir to incorporate.  8. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley. 1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 2. On a generously floured work surface, roll out one of the dough discs into a roughly 12-inch circle no more than 1/4 inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out four or five rounds. Reclaim the dough scraps. 3. Place about 1 1/2 tbsp of filling in the centre of each round. Lightly brush the edges of each round with the egg wash. Working with one at a time, form a triangle by folding three "sides" up and over the filling, leaving about 1 inch of filling uncovered. Pinch the edges together well (so they won't come apart as they bake). Place on a prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is no more dough remaining. 5. Bake the pastries until light golden and the filling is bubbling, ±25 minutes. 6. Let cool for ±5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and let cool.  ;Baking;115;2-3 hours;recipe-book-main\Recipes\Baking\Goldenstars.md
Laumberry Pie;Frozen Piecrusts,Blackberries,Raspberries,Granulated Sugar,Corn Starch,Salt,Lemon,Vanilla Extract,Apple Jelly;1 cup;1. On a floured work surface, roll out one of the pie crusts into an oval, 14x7". Cut out 7" circles, and work into a small bowl or pie plate. Cover in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. 2. Preheat the oven to 350F. 3. Place the frozen dough-lined plates on a rimmed baking sheet, and line with aluminium foil and pie weights. 4. Bake the crusts until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden (25-30 min) and remove the foil and weights. Bake for another 12 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. 5. Place 2 cups of the mixed blackberries/blueberries in a medium bowl, and set aside. 6. In a food processor, puree the remaining blackberries/blueberries until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a saucepan, scraping and pressing on the solids to extract as much puree  as possible. Add the solids to the saucepan also. 7. In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, the corn starch, and salt. Mix this into the berry puree. 8. Set the saucepan over medium heat and bhring to a strong simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom constantly. Cook until the mixture is thickened and pudding-like (~20 minutes).

Add the raspberries, and toss very gently to coat and mix with the other berries. 10. Divide the puree over the pie crusts, and add the glazed berries on top. Chill for 3 hours to a day before serving. ;Baking;14;0;recipe-book-main\Recipes\Baking\Laumberry Pie.md
Loaf Pudding;Flour,Almond Meal,Baking Powder,Salt,Butter,Granulated Sugar,Egg,Vanilla Extract,Almond Extract,Yogurt,Almonds,Granulated Sugar,Salt,Vanilla Extract,Almonds Extract,Simple Syrup;;1. With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 180°C. 2. Coat a loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, place a wire rack on top, set aside. 3. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt; whisk to incorporate, and set aside. 4. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula once or twice. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond  extract, beat well, and scrape down again. 5. Add about 1/3  of the flour mixture, followed by 1/2 of the yogurt, mixing after each addition until just incorporated. Repeat. 6. Add the remaining flour mixture, and mix until the batter is smooth. > [!warning] Be careful not to overmix. 7. Using a flexible spatula, scrape the batter into the loaf pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle the almonds down the centre. Bake the loaf until the top is browned, the edges begin to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick comes out clean (±45 minutes), rotating the pan halfway through. Let cool for about 8 minutes. 8. Carefully turn the loaf out onto the rack and set right-side up. 9. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and salt and bring to a steamy simmer, dissolving the sugar. Continue simmering until glossy bubbles develop and the liquid is slightly thickened. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, add the vanilla and almond extract, and swirl to incorporate. > [!tip] Using regular Simple Syrup saves a little bit of time, as you do not have to combine the sugar, water and salt. 10. While the loaf is still hot, use a long skewer to poke deep holes on its bottom and sides, as well as along both sides of the almonds on top. Brush the syrup over the holes all over the loaf, allowing it to be absorbed. Return the loaf to the rack to cool to room temperature. Slice and serve. ;Baking;11;0;recipe-book-main\Recipes\Baking\Loaf Pudding.md
